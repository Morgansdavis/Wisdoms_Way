In my deeper dives into self, there has been one shining constant: Lisa Rambaldo. Her ability to nurture a kind, inquisitive movement inward has been immensely rewarding and empowering Lisa holds space for me in many ways, including astrology/Tarot, MBSR, yoga/ meditation, and Jungian coaching. I am profoundly grateful for Lisa's abilities, insights, kindness, and expertise.
