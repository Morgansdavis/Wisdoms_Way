Working with Lisa and her Jungian coaching has been transformational. She holds a safe space for me to explore deeper shadow aspects of myself, offering tools and ways to shift and integrate these experiences. I give her a 10/10 rating and highly recommend her to anyone seeking guidance to understand themselves better, transform old habits/beliefs or just looking for help in becoming a better human.
